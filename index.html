    <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
    <img src="audrip.jpg" width="110" height="150" alt="Tajreyan Audrip"/>

    <p>My name is <strong>Tajreyan Audrip</strong>, and I am a student of <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> at <strong>Brac University</strong>. At the moment, I study in my 3rd semester and live in the Residential Campus where students combine the academic environment with personal development.  

        Basically, I have a highly organized daily schedule at the Residential Campus. Days begin when people get up early and often, they go for a walk or practice in the morning, then have breakfast together with compatriots. Lecture and other class activities consume a greater portion of each day: The lectures are always informative and include practical exercises. Class is taken during the morning while afternoons are left for either group study or any other work. I especially spend much time in the evening since I like to play football or badminton or take a walk around the campus, if we are not attending any professional meetings. Students spend time doing homework after dinner, but I prefer to study alone before going to bed or talking to friends.  
        
        I think one of the most important aspects of the Residential Campus is the activity level of the residents. Most of the students found that studying with children from other backgrounds makes the class more productive and informative. The campus itself is green and serene, which makes it conducive for either study or relaxation.  
        
        But yes, there are things that I miss. I have been longing to be back home with my family and indulge in home sweet home. However, sometimes there is very little that is left open-ended, and little opportunity is available to go out and explore the world around you if one goes to University.  
        
        In conclusion, life within the Residential Campus is a daily amazing and life-altering experience that impacts my educational process as well as spiritual development.</p>
